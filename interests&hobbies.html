        <p id="style2">
            I enjoy playing games both with friends and solo. Some of my favorites include Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Minecraft — nothing too fancy, just games that help me relax and have fun. 
            Gaming is also a great way for me to stay connected with friends and unwind after a busy day.

        <p id="style4">
            I’ve always enjoyed being active and playing sports. I especially like football and sometimes volleyball. 
            I also enjoy watching football when I get the chance — it’s exciting to see teamwork and strategy come together on the field and also seeing the big hits that would come from players.

        <h2 id="style5">Music</h2>
        <p id="style6">
            Music is a big part of my daily routine. Whether I'm working or coding, I always have something playing in the background or in my ears. 
            It helps me stay focused and motivated throughout the day. I enjoy a variety of genres, but I usually go towards a more chill vibe. The only genre I decpise is country music.

        <h2 id="style7">Outdoor Activities</h2>
        <p id="style8">
            I like spending time outdoors and working on projects that let me use my hands. 
            I also enjoy fishing from time to time — it’s peaceful, rewarding, and a nice break from screens.

        <h2 id="style9">Cars</h2>
        <p id="style10">
            I’ve always been fascinated by cars, especially sports cars. 
            If a car catches my eye and sounds amazing, I’m hooked instantly. I love learning about performance, design, and what makes each car unique. I also like working on cars when I can, as it’s a great way to understand how they function and improve my mechanical skills. My dream car is a Lamborghini SVJ.
