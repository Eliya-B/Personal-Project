                Hi, I'm Eliya Blidchenko! I'm passionate about learning, creating, and solving problems in many different situations. I enjoy working with technology and exploring new tools that would benefit me and make me more efficient. I'm currently studying software development that explores new programming languages, such as Java or Python, and many different frameworks. I'm always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge, whether it be at school or in my day-to-day life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of my skills include programming, problem-solving, teamwork, and adapting to new challenges. I'm always eager to grow and take on new opportunities. I believe in continuous learning, persistence, and collaborating with others to solve problems. I enjoy approaching challenges, most of the time, creatively, and finding innovative solutions to overcome that problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of studying or work, I enjoy hobbies like gaming, playing sports, and listening to music. I like finding ways to combine my interests with learning and self-improvement.In my free time, I would tinker around with cars, do some sort of activity, or go sit down and play some games by myself or with friends to pass the time. I like to combine my hobbies with learning, which makes days more exciting and fulfilling.
            </p>
